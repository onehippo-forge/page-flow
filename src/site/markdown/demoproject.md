## Demo Project

### Build and Run

You can build and install the module locally first in the project root folder.

```bash
$ mvn clean install
```

And you can build and run the Demo project:

```bash
$ cd demo
$ mvn clean verify && mvn -Pcargo.run
```

For testing, visit http://localhost:8080/site/campaign1.

### Demo Page Flow Definition

In the demo project, the Page Flow definition for the channel (http://localhost:8080/site/campaign1) is defined
in the following document:

> ![Demo Page Flow Definition 1](images/demoflowdef1.png "Demo Page Flow Definition 1")

The above Page Flow Definition document is equivalent to the following Finite State Machine diagram:

- Visitor starts the journey by visiting the **Landing Page** page state.
- On "start.quote" event (usually an event is triggerd by a user's action in the step page), it would
be transitioned to **Plan Selection** page state.
- On "family.plan.selected" event, it would be transitioned to **Dependents Entry** page state, which would be
  transitioned to **Application Entry** page state afterward.
  Or on "single.plan.selected" event, it would be transitioned to **Application Entry** page state directly.
- On "application.submitted" event, it would be transitioned to **Review** page state.
- On "application.reviewed" event, it would be transitioned to **Payment** page state.
- On "payment.accepted" event, it would be transitioned to **Confirmation** page state, which leads to **Final End** state.
  Or on "payment.rejected" event, it would stay in the **Payment** page state.
- **Application Entry**, **Review** and **Payment** page states could be transitioned back to the **Landing Page** page state
  on "cancel.requested" event.
