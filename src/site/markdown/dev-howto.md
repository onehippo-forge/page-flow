## Developer's How-to

### Introduction

**Page Flow Module** simplifies Page State definitions, Page State Transitions based on Events, Error Handling
per Page State and metadata handlings in web applications.

Normally, each Page State is mapped to an HST Page with an unique URI path info.
You may have multiple, different ```HstComponent```s in each HST Page like you do in normal HST-2 web application development.

As **Page Flow Module** aims to cover visitors' interactions across (multi-step) HST Pages,
it is not interested in providing too tightly coupled framework with MVC form/action handling, unlike Spring Web Flow for example.

In that sense, it is the ```HstComponent```s responsibility to send an event to trigger Page State Transitions.
**Page Flow Module** would not send events or trigger transitions on a Page Flow instance automatically
based on ```HstComponent```'s status changes.

Also, it is not an interest of **Page Flow Module** to provide a *bridging* solution between ```HstComponent``` and
other web flow control frameworks such as Spring Web Flow
because that kind of approaches would simply force the flow interactions to stay in the specific ```HstComponent``` only,
causing inflexibility in page/component compositions and significant limitations in Relevance personalization and
Experiment (A/B Testing).

### Page Flow Definition

First of all, you need to create and publish a **Page Flow Definition** which is applied to a Microsite campaign channel
or selected sitemap items, like the following example document in CMS:

The above **Page Flow Definition** document defines all the page states, events and transitions in the document editor.
It shows all the definitions including **Page State**s, **Event**s and **Page Transition**s in flat lists.
But, due to the **Page Transition** fields, each of which consists of a source **Event** and a target **Page State**,
the whole **Page Flow** can represents the following *Finite State Machine* diagram:

### Page State Definition and HST Page

As shown above, each **Page State** has **Path** field which is normally mapped to the URI path of an **HST Page**.
So, while a **Page Flow** instance for a visitor is alive, the visitor should be passing along a specific
**Page State** based on events and transitions.
By default in HST-2 web application, each **Page State** is represented by an **HST Page**, which means that
the request from a visitor hits an **HST SiteMap Item** and the associated **HST Page** is being rendered for
the **Page State**.

This default behavior in HST-2 web application has the following advantages:

- You can separate each step of the visitor's interactions into a separate **HST Page**, so it is more flexible
  when composing each page with different components/templates and personalization.
- You can even set a specific step page URI as an Experiment goal easily.
- In an **HST Page**, one of ```HstComponent```s may process an action to retrieve the current ```PageFlow``` to send an event
  to trigger an automatic transition. Once a transition occurs by the event, the default **Page Flow HstSiteMapItemHandler**
  will redirect the page to the next step automatically.
  Therefore, ```HstComponent```s do not have to handle any physical navigation/redirection handling by themselves any more
  as it is handled by **Page Flow Module**.

*Note*: It is possible to customize the default HST-2 based Page Flow Control and interpret the logical **Path**
        information of each **Page State** in application-specific ways.

### Events and Page State Transitions

Let's take a look at the ```CampaignQuoteComponent.java```, as an example, shown in the first step landing page in the demo project:

```
public class CampaignQuoteComponent extends AbstractCampaignComponent {

    private static final Pattern US_ZIP_PATTERN = Pattern.compile("^\\d{5}$");

    @Override
    public void doAction(HstRequest request, HstResponse response) throws HstComponentException {
        final String zip = StringUtils.trim(request.getParameter("zip"));

        final PageFlow pageFlow = getPageFlow();
        final CampaignModel campaignModel = new CampaignModel();
        campaignModel.setZip(zip);
        pageFlow.setAttribute(CampaignConstants.DEFAULT_MODEL_NAME, campaignModel);

        if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(zip)) {
            final Matcher m = US_ZIP_PATTERN.matcher(zip);

            if (m.matches()) {
                pageFlow.sendEvent(CampaignConstants.EVENT_START_QUOTE);
            }
        }
    }

}
```

*CampaignQuoteComponent#doAction()* method is invoked when a visitor clicks on **Start!** button in the first landing page,
doing the following:

- Read the only form input, "zip" code.
- Retrieve the current ```PageFlow``` instance which was resolved and provided by the **Page Flow Module** automatically.
- Instantiate a new domain model object, ```CampaignModel```, set the zip code and store it into ```pageFlow```, so that you can retrieve
  the domain model object later in other **Page State**s.
- Finally, if everything is okay, it sends an event named ```CampaignConstants.EVENT_START_QUOTE```
(which should be same as one of the event names in the **Page Flow Definition** document).
- Under the hood, **Page Flow Module** process the event and make transition(s) if needed.
  In this example, it will be transitioned to the next step ("Select a Plan") automatically.

In summary,

- ```HstComponent```s should not try to redirect pages in most cases, but instead it simply retrieves the currently
resolved ```PageFlow``` and sends an event to trigger transitions.
- To send an event from an ```HstComponent```, invoke ```PageFlow#sendEvent(String eventName)```.
  Then **Page Flow Module** will automatically handle the event and make transition(s) if needed, as you defined
  the flow in the **Page Flow Definition** document.

### APIs to Get Access to PageFlow and PageStates

You can retrieve the automatically resolved ```PageFlow``` instance like the following:

```
    protected PageFlow getPageFlow() {
        final HstRequestContext requestContext = RequestContextProvider.get();
        final PageFlowControl flowControl = PageFlowControl.getDefault(requestContext.getServletRequest());
        return flowControl.getPageFlow(requestContext.getServletRequest());
    }
```

*HstComponent* code should retrieve the ```PageFlowControl``` by invoking ```PageFlowControl#getDefault(HttpServletRequest)``` first, and
get the ```PageFlow``` throught ```PageFlowControl#getPageFlow(HttpServletRequest)```.

**Page Flow Module** automatically finds a **PageFlow** instance for the visitor by retrieving a stored one
or instantiate a new one if it is a new visitor.

You can also retrieve all the defined **PageState** s from the **PageFlow**.

The following FreeMarker template example is from the navigation status bar at the page bottom in the demo project:

```
<#assign curPageState=pageFlow.pageState>
<#assign curPageStateIndex=curPageState.index>

<div class="text-left">
  <#list pageFlow.pageStates as pageState>
    <#if pageState.index < curPageStateIndex>
      <span class="label label-success">${pageState.name}</span>
    <#elseif pageState.index == curPageStateIndex>
      <span class="label label-primary">${pageState.name}</span>
    <#else>
      <span class="label label-default">${pageState.name}</span>
    </#if>
  </#list>
</div>
```

*PageFlow#getPageState()* returns the current **PageState**.
```PageFlow#getPageStates()``` returns a collection of all the defined **PageState** s.

For more details, see [JavaDocs](apidocs/index.html).

### APIs to Store Domain Objects in Page Flow

A Page Flow for a visitor is a longer journey than simple webpage.
So, you might want to store some domain specific data for the visitor's journey. e.g, multi-step application form data.

As shown above, you may use ```PageFlow#setAttribute(String, Object)``` to store and retrieve arbitrary objects for your application.

For more details, see [JavaDocs](apidocs/index.html).

### APIs for Error Handling in Page State

In an ```HstComponent```, you might want to store all the collected errors while processing the form and use those error objects
in view templates.

To store error objects, you can use ```PageState#addErrors(Errors)```, ```PageState#getErrorsMap()```, etc.

For more details, see [JavaDocs](apidocs/index.html).

A good example for error handling ```HstComponent``` and FreeMarker template can be found in the following sources in the demo project:

- [CampaignApplicationFormComponent.java](https://github.com/bloomreach-forge/page-flow/blob/master/demo/site/src/main/java/org/onehippo/forge/pageflow/demo/campaign/components/CampaignApplicationFormComponent.java)
- [campaign-application-form.ftl](https://github.com/bloomreach-forge/page-flow/blob/master/demo/repository-data/webfiles/src/main/resources/site/freemarker/campaignbase/campaign-application-form.ftl)
